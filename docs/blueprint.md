# **App Name**: Ethereal Folio

## Core Features:

- Home Page: Displays the developer's name using a fade-in effect. Shows social media links as icons, animated on hover. A subtle CSS gradient background enhances the aesthetic.
- Projects Page: Presents a grid of project cards that use filters to categorize projects (web, design, blog, other). Clicking a project opens it in a modal with detailed information.
- Education Timeline: A static education timeline shows milestones, which highlights with a glow effect upon hover. It has clear descriptions of each qualification, and may be either a vertical or horizontal layout
- Skillset Summary: Displays icons or tags that visually summarize key skills. It has tooltip on hover that reveals the experience level (e.g. two years). The tooltip message might be dynamically modified in cases where number of years might sound unnatural ('native fluency')
- AI Blog Summary Tool: Generate a summary of the blog preview to be shown when hovering a Blog Preview card
- Blog Page: Features blog preview cards that flip on hover to reveal a brief summary. Includes a search bar and category filter (front-end only) to easily filter articles by topics and keywords.
- Contact Page: Offers a minimalist form with glowing input fields on focus and social media icons for alternative contact options. The 'Submit' button turns into a checkmark upon submission (front-end validation only).

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A desaturated gray (#808080) to maintain a minimalist aesthetic.
- Background color: Dark gray (#222222) to provide a professional, muted backdrop.
- Accent color: Light gray (#AAAAAA) to highlight interactive elements subtly.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font for a clean and modern look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Simple vector icons are used for the navbar. Each icon includes a hover tooltip indicating its section name, such as 'Projects'. A sliding underline highlights the currently active page.
- A static, multi-page design with no scrolling, ensuring each section (Home, Projects, Education, Blog, Contact) is accessed via navbar icons, enhancing the site's focused and direct navigation.
- Smooth fade-in and fade-out page transitions offer a fluid navigation experience between static pages.
